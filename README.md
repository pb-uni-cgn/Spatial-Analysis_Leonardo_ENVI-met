# Spatial-Analysis_Leonardo_ENVI-met
This repository contains the codes for spatial analysis that have been written for the work on microclimatic effects in Cologne-SÃ¼dstadt. There are code versions
that can be used for analysis on EDX/EDT-Output Files and those for NetCDF-Outputs. I propose to use NetCDF files as the processing time is significantly shorter and even 
computer with less power can execute larger spatial analyzes. 

The scripts are structured in the following groups:
> Scripts for NetCDF-outputs which can be used in Leonardo-DataStudio

> Scripts for EDX/EDT-outputs which can be used in Leonardo-DataStudio

> A Script for QGIS to get the coordinates of predefined polygons in your model world
